A lightweight and secure Chrome extension to instantly generate a Microsoft Teams meeting link from any text field on the web.

---

## üìñ About The Project

Frequent Microsoft Teams users often need to create impromptu meeting links while working in other web applications like email, project management tools, or CRMs. The standard workflow‚Äîswitching to the Teams app, navigating menus, creating the meeting, copying the link, and switching back‚Äîis disruptive and time-consuming.

This browser extension streamlines that entire process into a single click. It provides a simple, secure, and incredibly fast way to generate a new Microsoft Teams meeting link and either insert it directly into your current workspace or access it from a clean popup UI.

### ‚ú® Key Features

*   **One-Click Generation:** Right-click in any editable text field (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, etc.) and select "Generate Teams Meeting Join Link".
*   **Instant Feedback:** See the text `*Generating meeting link...*` appear immediately, which is then replaced by the real meeting URL.
*   **Convenient Popup UI:**
    *   Click the extension icon to view a history of your last 3 generated meeting links.
    *   Each entry includes the page title and timestamp for easy identification.
    *   Generate new links directly from the popup.
    *   Easily copy links or remove them from your history.
*   **Secure Authentication:** Uses the official Microsoft Identity Platform (OAuth 2.0 PKCE Flow) for authentication. Your password is never seen, handled, or stored by the extension.
*   **Privacy-Focused:** No meeting data or personal information is ever sent to an external server. All generated link history is stored locally and securely on your computer.
*   **Zero Dependencies:** Built with 100% vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for maximum performance and security.

You are now ready to use the extension locally!

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project uses Manifest V3 and is organized as follows:

*   `manifest.json`: The core configuration file for the Chrome extension. Defines permissions, scripts, and properties.
*   `background.js`: The extension's service worker. It handles all core logic, including authentication, API calls to Microsoft Graph, context menu creation, and event handling.
*   `popup.html`: The HTML structure for the popup UI that appears when you click the extension icon.
*   `popup.js`: The JavaScript that powers the popup. It fetches recent links from the background script, renders the list, and handles user interactions like copying or removing links.
*   `popup.css`: The stylesheet for the popup UI, including the custom color palette.
*   `icons/`: A directory containing the 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel icons for the extension.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Policy

This extension is built with privacy as a priority.

*   **Authentication:** All authentication is handled by Microsoft's official login pages. This extension **never** sees, stores, or transmits your password.
*   **Data Usage:** The extension only requests the minimum permissions required to function: creating meetings (`OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite`) and reading your name to personalize the meeting subject (`User.Read`).
*   **Data Storage:** The extension stores two types of data, both **only on your local computer**:
    1.  **OAuth Tokens:** The authentication tokens provided by Microsoft are stored securely in `chrome.storage.local` so you don't have to log in every time.
    2.  **Meeting History:** The last 3 generated meeting links (including the page title and timestamp) are stored in `chrome.storage.local` to power the popup UI. This data is never transmitted anywhere.
*   **No External Servers:** This extension communicates only with the Microsoft Graph API. There are no third-party servers involved.
